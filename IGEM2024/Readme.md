## Project Summary:

We are concerned about T2DM, a chronic disease with serious complications and a rising incidence rate worldwide. We focus on BcoAT to enhance the synthesis of its SCFAs and program the glucose responsive secretion of GLP-1 to build a synthetic biological reactor through the method of synthetic biology, with the probiotic ECN1917 as the chassis. When blood sugar levels rise after each meal, GLP-1 is released to rapidly lower blood sugar to baseline levels. In order to achieve the above functions, this project designed a GLP-1 recombinant protein, with PelB as the lead sequence connected to GLP-1 to enhance its extracellular secretion function. DnaK, a key protein of the blood glucose control module, is expressed at the tail of GLP-1 through flexible linker peptides to achieve its programmed release. During the experimental phase, the release of GLP-1 regulated by glucose concentration was validated through gradient dilution and ELISA quantitative detection.
